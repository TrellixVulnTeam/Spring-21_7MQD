# Spring-21

Uploaded folders contains all the projects that I did during Spring 2021.

## SG-Net-Master
My primary project SG-Net-Master is an implementation of this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05147 which was published in 2019.
The code was initially forked from the github of the author and then modified accoridng to my goal. The descriptions will be found inside the folder.

## Assignments
The assignments contains reviews of a paper titled "Visualizing the Loss Landscape of Neural
Nets" and a short summary of 3 papers which participated in the SQuAD 2.0 challenge. The Jupyter notebook visualizes how the loss surface diverges to local minimum. 

##Transformer Using Pytorch
This project was done in order to learn how to use pytorch transformers. In this project I used the transformer library as an intact module, and also used 
library of encoder and decoder to form a transformer to do the same thing.


##BERT Transformer
BERT Transformer user the pretrained library from the Huggingface transformers library. The goal of this project is sentiment analysis.
